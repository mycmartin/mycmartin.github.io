## Overview
Developed an edge-computing detection system integrating UAV/robot video capture, inference acceleration, remote streaming, and visualization.

## Tech Stack
RTMP, PyQt, MySQL, TensorRT, PyTorch.

## My Role
- Implemented the UI/visualization workflow with PyQt.
- Integrated TensorRT-accelerated detection models to improve edge inference speed.
- Logged results to MySQL in real time and supported video storage and playback.
